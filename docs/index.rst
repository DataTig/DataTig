DataTig
=======

DataTig is a set of tools to help when:

* A community of people want to crowd source a data set
* They use a git repository to store the data

In these cases, the tools can be used on the git repository to help people contribute new data or edit existing data, check data quality and transform the data into more useful forms for everyone to re-use.
