What this section covers
------------------------

*  Ways other people can use this data

Others can use your data
------------------------

We've started our list of bike shops; we've set up a website that encourages other people to contribute to it.

We want others to use this data.

Fortunately, DataTig includes tools to make the data we are collecting very accessible.

Go to the website that Netlify is building for you.

On the home page is a button to "Download SQLite Database". This downloads a database file that includes all the data. It can be opened it a tool like https://sqlitebrowser.org/

Click on "Shops" then any shop. There is a button to "Download Raw JSON Data". This will give you the data for that shop in JSON form.

In themselves, these things may not seem very useful. What will someone do with these?

But the point here is that DataTig is making your data available in an API ("Application Programming Interface") for others to consume and use.

You, or other people, can build other tools such as websites on top of these APIs.

By doing this, others can take your data and re-use it. This means your data has helped more people. It also means that people will be keener to submit new data and corrections to your repository.

This Open Data is something DataTig is designed to encourage.
