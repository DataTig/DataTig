Site Configuration
==================

Location
--------

Each site should have a `datatig.json` or `datatig.yaml` file at it's root. This contains configuration for that site.

The schema of each file is the same.

We recommend using `datatig.yaml` - it is easier to edit, and you can have comments.

General
-------

* `title` - A string. The title of the whole site.
* `description` - A string. A description for the whole site.

A YAML example:

.. code-block:: yaml

    title: Test register
    description: The data for a test

Git Host
